Link to live app:
https://thinkful-ei-unicorn.github.io/kevin-enloe-bookmarks-app/

bookmarks can be added to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)

The list of bookmarks shows up the app is first opened

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
they can be clicked on to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
bookmarks can be removed from this screen

when a bookmark submission is incorrect it prompts the user to fill in the area required

the App supports a dropdown element that has a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
